Client

Doubletake vintage & consignment is a clothing resale shop near Seattle, WA, which specializes in vintage clothing, costumes and accessories. Doubletake occupies a niche with few credible competitors having either the same-quality inventory or the ability to acquire hard-to-find clothing items, no matter how unusual. 

Doubletake is a go-to resource for anyone with costume and vintage clothing needs, and routinely receives inquiries from other cities in the US, and even from Europe and Asia. 

Patrons love being in the store. Owner Connie Marsh is a lot of fun to talk to, a fountain of knowledge of all things, and offers an in-store atmosphere that’s relaxed and playful while being productive to shoppers trying to meet very specific needs, often on short notice. 

Project

Doubletake’s former site design was, in Connie’s words, “better than having no site at all.” The basics were there: phone, address, hours, but Users got no sense of what being in the store was like. For Connie, getting people into the store so they can see what it’s like for themselves is primary. A site that gives a sense of the in-store experience is essential to meeting this goal. 

I re-aligned the information architecture to enable Users quickly find what’s there, by category. I put location and phone at the top, integrated into a new logo/brandmark which I designed, in the shape of a clothing store price tag. Use of static photography is a good way for people to see what’s in stock; live video via Skype is an even better way to show what’s there right that minute.

Issues

Predictable unpredictability

The nature of supplying the hard-to-find is that there’s not a lot of each item. To keep things fresh, new stock must be brought in constantly. The site must show this ever-changing inventory because you never know when a shopper will need an item that could arrive and be sold in the space of an afternoon. 

Visual elements

Doubletake patrons know generally what they can expect in the store: anything. Fresh, current photography lets them know whether to come in, and in creating the new design, I put this idea first.
Fresh, current photography will always be integral to the success of this site in its ability to draw people to the store.

Updatability

A CMS is the best choice to enable Doubletake’s staff to upload photos, change descriptions, post events, add comments, and deal with patron requests on the fly throughout the day.
